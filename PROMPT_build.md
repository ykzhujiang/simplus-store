# Building Mode Prompt

## Instructions

0a. Study `specs/*` with up to 500 parallel Sonnet subagents to learn the application specifications.
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.
0c. For reference, the application source code is in `src/*`.

1. Your task is to implement functionality per the specifications using parallel subagents. Follow @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and choose the most important item to address. Before making changes, search the codebase (don't assume not implemented) using Sonnet subagents. You may use up to 500 parallel Sonnet subagents for searches/reads and only 1 Sonnet subagent for build/tests. Use Opus subagents when complex reasoning is needed (debugging, architectural decisions).

2. After implementing functionality or resolving problems, run the tests for that unit of code that was improved. If functionality is missing then it's your job to add it as per the application specifications. Ultrathink.

3. When you discover issues, immediately update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with your findings using a subagent. When resolved, update and remove the item.

4. When the tests pass, update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, then `git add -A` then `git commit` with a message describing the changes. After the commit, `git push`.

## Task Scoping (Wave-Based Execution)

If `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` contains wave-based tasks with `depends_on` fields:

1. **Only work on tasks whose dependencies are ALL satisfied** (status ✅ Done)
2. **Pick the highest-priority unblocked task** from the earliest incomplete wave
3. **Respect the `location` field** — only modify files listed in your task's location
4. **Update task status** when starting (🔨 In progress) and finishing (✅ Done)
5. **Fill in `log` and `files_modified`** with what you actually did

### ⚠️ TASK_SCOPE — MANDATORY for Parallel Worktrees

**FIRST: Check the top of IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for a TASK_SCOPE constraint.**

If a `TASK_SCOPE` constraint exists, you **MUST** obey it:
- **ONLY** work on the specified task(s)
- **IGNORE** all other tasks, even if they appear unblocked or higher priority
- **DO NOT** modify files outside the scope of the specified tasks
- This overrides the "pick highest-priority unblocked task" rule above

```markdown
<!-- TASK_SCOPE: T10 — Only work on this task. Do not touch other tasks. -->
```

**Why this exists:** In parallel worktree setups, multiple IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN copies exist across branches. Without TASK_SCOPE, Claude Code will pick the lowest-numbered unblocked task regardless of which Phase it belongs to, causing worktrees to build the wrong features.

## Guardrails (Higher Number = More Critical)

99999. Important: When authoring documentation, capture the why — tests and implementation importance.

999999. Important: Single sources of truth, no migrations/adapters. If tests unrelated to your work fail, resolve them as part of the increment.

9999999. As soon as there are no build or test errors create a git tag. If there are no git tags start at 0.0.0 and increment patch by 1 for example 0.0.1 if 0.0.0 does not exist.

99999999. You may add extra logging if required to debug issues.

999999999. Keep @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md current with learnings using a subagent — future work depends on this to avoid duplicating efforts. Update especially after finishing your turn.

9999999999. When you learn something new about how to run the application, update @AGENTS.md using a subagent but keep it brief. For example if you run commands multiple times before learning the correct command then that file should be updated.

99999999999. For any bugs you notice, resolve them or document them in @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md using a subagent even if it is unrelated to the current piece of work.

999999999999. Implement functionality completely. Placeholders and stubs waste efforts and time redoing the same work.

9999999999999. When @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md becomes large periodically clean out the items that are completed from the file using a subagent.

99999999999999. If you find inconsistencies in the specs/* then use an Opus subagent with 'ultrathink' requested to update the specs.

999999999999999. IMPORTANT: Keep @AGENTS.md operational only — status updates and progress notes belong in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`. A bloated AGENTS.md pollutes every future loop's context.

9999999999999999. VISUAL WORK: When building dashboards, web UIs, or anything visual — USE THE BROWSER TOOL to actually view the page. Don't just write code and assume it works:
   - `browser action=open targetUrl="http://localhost:PORT"` to open
   - `browser action=snapshot` to see the current state
   - Verify layout, styling, data display actually works
   - Visual bugs are invisible without visual verification

99999999999999999. CRITICAL — TASK_SCOPE ENFORCEMENT: If IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md contains a TASK_SCOPE comment at the top, you MUST NOT work on any task outside that scope. This is the highest priority rule. Re-read the TASK_SCOPE before picking any task. Violation wastes hours of compute on the wrong feature.

## Customization Notes

Adjust paths if your source code isn't in `src/`:
- `src/*` → your source directory

Adjust validation commands in AGENTS.md for your project:
- Tests: `npm test`, `pytest`, `go test ./...`, etc.
- Typecheck: `tsc --noEmit`, `mypy .`, etc.
- Lint: `eslint .`, `ruff .`, etc.
